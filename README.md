- **Real-World Applications**: Economic forecasting, financial econometrics, labor economics, and development economics
- **Causal Inference**: How AI enhances traditional causal inference methods
- **Challenges and Solutions**: Addressing interpretability, overfitting, and bias issues
- **Case Studies**: Practical examples of AI implementation in economic research
- **Software Tools**: Programming languages, libraries, and frameworks
- **Future Directions**: Emerging technologies and research opportunities

## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

To compile the LaTeX document, you'll need:
- A LaTeX distribution (e.g., [TeX Live](https://www.tug.org/texlive/), [MiKTeX](https://miktex.org/))
- Make utility (optional, for using the Makefile)

### Compilation

#### Using Make (Recommended)

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/fredericmirindi/econai.git
cd econai

# Compile the PDF
make

# Clean auxiliary files
make clean

# Clean all files including PDF
make clean-all

# Force rebuild
make rebuild

# Show help
make help
```

#### Manual Compilation

```bash
# Compile the LaTeX document
pdflatex ai_econometrics.tex
pdflatex ai_econometrics.tex  # Run twice for proper references

# The output will be ai_econometrics.pdf
```
